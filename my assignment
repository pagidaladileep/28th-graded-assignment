Question 2 - 

Description: Write a program in Python to print the number of unique letters in a string. Only new letters from the string should be counted and not duplicates.

                                  

Input : string1 = "India"

Output : uniqueLetters = i,n,d,a


Input : string1 = "Dedication"

Output : uniqueLetters = d,e,i,c,a,t,o,n

soluton:


l1=input("enter string: ");
l1=l1.lower()
l2=[]
for i  in l1:
    if i not in l2:
        l2.append(i)
print("Unique letters : ",end="")
for i in l2:
    print(i,end="")
    if (i!=l2[len(l2)-1]):
        print(",",end="")
        
        

Question 1 - 

Description - Create a small command-line program in Python to calculate the total invoice amount for the below purchases - 

Book - Introduction to Python Programming : Rs 499.00

Book - Python Libraries Cookbook : Rs. 855.00

Book - Data Science in Python : Rs. 645.00


Taxes and additional charges are described as details - 

GST : 12%

Delivery Charges : Rs. 250.00

solution:

book1=int(input("Enter no.of books of Introduction to Python Programming : "))
book2=int(input("Enter no.of books of Python Libraries Cookbook : "))
book3=int(input("Enter no.of books of Data Science in Python : "))
b1=book1*499.0
b2=book2*855.0
b3=book3*645.0
sum=b1+b2+b3
gst=(0.12*sum)
delivery_charge=250
total_cost=sum+gst+delivery_charge
print("Total Cost : ",total_cost)
